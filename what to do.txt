Of react-router:
A route is a pairing between the address appearing on the address bar and the components that should be appearing on the screen at any given time.

import { BrowserRouter, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

the BrowserRouter is the brains of the router and choose the set of components for any URL of the app
the Route object is a react component to set up a rule between a certain a route a user might visit and the set of components visible on the screen
